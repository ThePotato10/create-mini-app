# create-mini-app
#### Creates a streamlined version of what create-react-app generates
<hr>
<a href='https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app' target='_blank'>create-react-app</a> is incredibly useful, but sometimes, you're not trying to make a PWA. Because of this, you have to manually comb through an delete serviceWorker.js and a bunch of other files
<br><br>
<em>create-mini-app</em> builds on <em>create-react-app</em> by removing all the files you don't need if you're just building a React website or webapp

Currently, only a Bash version is available, but anyone is more than welcome to contribute a PowerShell version
